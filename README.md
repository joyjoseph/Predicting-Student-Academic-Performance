# Predicting-Student-Academic-Performance

## Inter-Track Project

### Problem statement

The goal is to Build a platform that can predict the academic performance of students. The product should be able to show a student's academic performance including drop off rate, academic success, data related to students, teacher information, student information, class attendance and academic scores.

The provided dataset was collected through the [UCI Machine Learning Repository](https://archive-beta.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/predict+students+dropout+and+academic+success), the dataset created from a higher education institution (acquired from several disjoint databases) related to students enrolled in different undergraduate degrees, such as agronomy, design, education, nursing, journalism, management, social service, and technologies. 
The dataset includes information known at the time of student enrollment (academic path, demographics, and social-economic factors) and the students' academic performance at the end of the first and second semesters.
