# Predicting-Student-Academic-Performance

## Inter-Track Project

### Problem statement

The goal is to Build a platform that can predict the academic performance of students. The product should be able to show a student's academic performance including drop off rate, academic success, data related to students, teacher information, student information, class attendance and academic scores.

The provided dataset was collected through the [UCI Machine Learning Repository](https://archive-beta.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/predict+students+dropout+and+academic+success), the dataset created from a higher education institution (acquired from several disjoint databases) related to students enrolled in different undergraduate degrees, such as agronomy, design, education, nursing, journalism, management, social service, and technologies. 
The dataset includes information known at the time of student enrollment (academic path, demographics, and social-economic factors) and the students' academic performance at the end of the first and second semesters. 

### Project Process

Every machine learning project follows a workflow and phases, depending on the project specifications.The phases followed to achieve this result include:

 1. Data collection
 2. Exploratory Data Analysis
 3. Data Preparation (Feature Engineering)
 4.  Modeling
 5.  Deployment

### File Hierarchy

[Predict File](https://github.com/joyjoseph/Predicting-Student-Academic-Performance/blob/master/Predict.py): The Predict.py file that shows the model prediction

[Process File](https://github.com/joyjoseph/Predicting-Student-Academic-Performance/blob/master/Procfile): The minimised version file of the Student_Performance.ipynb containing python codes for.

1. Data Visualisation
2. Data Preprocessing
3. Modeling
4. Results Analysis


[README.md](https://github.com/joyjoseph/Predicting-Student-Academic-Performance/blob/master/README.md): This is a summary file mostly rewritten as a documentation for all software processes.

[Student_Performance.ipynb](https://github.com/joyjoseph/Predicting-Student-Academic-Performance/blob/master/Student_Performance.ipynb): The original file containing python codes for;

1. Data Visualisation
2. Data Preprocessing
3. Modeling
4. Results Analysis.

[Technology justification document](https://github.com/joyjoseph/Predicting-Student-Academic-Performance/blob/master/Technology%20justification%20document.pdf): The document explains the rationale behind the tools and languages used on the project. For each tool used, the reason why they were chosen over other existing options.

[App file](https://github.com/joyjoseph/Predicting-Student-Academic-Performance/blob/master/app.py): This file contains the flask server deployment file sotored as app.py.

[Data folder](https://github.com/joyjoseph/Predicting-Student-Academic-Performance/blob/master/data%20(1).csv): The provided dataset was collected through the [UCI Machine Learning Repository](https://archive-beta.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/predict+students+dropout+and+academic+success), the dataset created from a higher education institution (acquired from several disjoint databases) related to students enrolled in different undergraduate degrees, such as agronomy, design, education, nursing, journalism, management, social service, and technologies. 
The dataset includes information known at the time of student enrollment (academic path, demographics, and social-economic factors) and the students' academic performance at the end of the first and second semesters. 
The file can be exported to csv format.

[Model joblib File](https://github.com/joyjoseph/Predicting-Student-Academic-Performance/blob/master/model_joblib.pkl): This is a serialised model file for offline batch prediction.

[Requirements File](https://github.com/joyjoseph/Predicting-Student-Academic-Performance/blob/master/requirements.txt): The requirements.txt file is the list of all libraries and their versions.

[Runtime File](https://github.com/joyjoseph/Predicting-Student-Academic-Performance/blob/master/runtime.txt): The runtime.txt file is the list of version of python used.

The dependencies can be imported by using "--import --name--".

Some of the dependencies are:

1. pandas
2. numpy
3. matplotlib
